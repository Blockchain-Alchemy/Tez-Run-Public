**Horse Racing and Staking** - A Play-to-Earn Game on [Tezos](https://tezos.com) by [@LexUnity](https://twitter.com/LexUnity) [@BlockAlc](https://twitter.com/BlockAlc)

## Summary

This Proof of Concept (POC) is part of the epic origin-story of Tez Run. This DAPP takes horse racing to Web3! This proof of concept does the following.

1. The Unity Web GL Game Module uses a verifiable random number generator from the Ubinetic oracle.
2. This POC has 6 horses participating in each race.
3. Each horse has its own parameters, such as maximum speed, which affect the chance of winning the race. These options are visible to users at any time. Our system uses a physics simulation system to create the most realistic and entertaining race scenario. The random number from oracle is passed into the simulation and each horse's top speed and horsepwoer are adjusted. 
4. There is a uUSD stablecoin staking pool. The POC also allows user to stake in Tezos on testnet and mainnet.
5. The platform takes a commission for each bet.
6. The race has a spectacular graphical representation, this may be the most  interesting race just to watch.
7. The project uses SmartPy smart contracts as a backend.
